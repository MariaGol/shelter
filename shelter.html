                    show that only 20% of them will find a family. The others will continue to live with us and will be
                    waiting for a lucky chance to become dearly loved.</h2>
                <h2 class="about__right__subtitle">We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they do not
                    get sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) and well. We are supported by 87 volunteers
                    and 28 employees of various skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the shelter staff.
                    Taking care of the animals, they become attached to the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.
